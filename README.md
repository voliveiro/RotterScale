## Rotter's Locus of Control Scale 

This browser-based application allows users to test the extent to which they have an internal or external locus of control. It is based on the PDF version of the test that can be found at: https://www.mccc.edu/~jenningh/Courses/documents/Rotter-locusofcontrolhandout.pdf. 

Notably, the PDF version of the test does not provide scores for questions 1, 8, 14, 19, 24, and 27. 

I have assigned 1 point to the following statements: 

Question 1: Children get into trouble because their parents punish them too much.

Question 8: Heredity plays the major role in determining one's personality. 

Question 14: There are certain people who are just no good.

Question 19: One should always be willing to admit mistakes.

Question 24: A good leader makes it clear to everybody what their jobs are.

Question 27: There is too much emphasis on athletics in high school.
